## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [DayZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/DayZ/) (game)
- [DayZ Server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223350/DayZ_Server/) (free, under Steam Library > Tools)
- All mods listed below subscribed in the Steam Workshop

### Setup

1. Install **DayZ Server** from Steam (Library > Tools)
2. Clone this repo into your DayZ Server directory, or copy the config files over your installation
3. Subscribe to all required mods in the Steam Workshop (see [Mods](#mods))
4. Launch DayZ once so Steam downloads the mod files
5. Copy each mod's Workshop folder into the server directory with the correct `@Name` (see [Mod Installation](#mod-installation))
6. Copy each mod's `.bikey` file from their `keys/` folder into the server's `keys/` folder
7. Edit `server_settings.json` to customize your server (see [Settings Patcher](#settings-patcher))
8. Double-click `apply_settings.bat` to apply your settings
9. Double-click `start.bat` to launch the server
10. Connect via DayZ > Servers > LAN, or Direct Connect to `127.0.0.1:2302`

## Settings Patcher

Instead of manually editing multiple config files scattered across the server, **all important settings live in one file**: `server_settings.json`.

### How to use

1. Open `server_settings.json` in any text editor
2. Change whatever you want
3. Double-click `apply_settings.bat`
4. Restart your server

That's it. The patcher reads your settings and writes them to the correct config files automatically.

| `network` | Voice chat, 3rd person, crosshair | `serverDZ.cfg` |
| `gameplay` | Stamina, base damage, map features, base building rules | `cfggameplay.json` |
| `zombies` | Spawn rates per category (city, coastal, military, wilderness, etc.) | `db/events.xml` |

### Example: Common tweaks

**Change your password:**
```json
"server": {
    "password": "mynewpassword",
    "adminPassword": "myadminpass"
}
```

**Make nights shorter (or remove them):**
```json
"time": {
    "acceleration": 6,
    "nightAcceleration": 12
}
```
Higher `nightAcceleration` = shorter nights. Set `acceleration` to 1 for real-time.

**Disable all zombies in the wilderness:**
```json
"zombies": {
    "wilderness": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0, "max": 0 }
}
```

**Double zombies at military bases:**
```json
"zombies": {
    "military":     { "nominal": 100, "min": 50, "max": 500 },
    "militaryHard": { "nominal": 100, "min": 50, "max": 500 }
}
```

**Show your position on the map (easier navigation):**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "showPlayerOnMap": true,
    "mapWithoutItem": true
}
```

**Relaxed base building (place anywhere):**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "relaxedBaseBuilding": true
}
```

**More stamina, less punishing weight:**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "staminaMax": 200.0,
    "staminaWeightThreshold": 12000.0,
    "sprintStaminaModifier": 0.5
}
```

**Make zombies sprint during the day too:**
```json
"zombieBehavior": {
    "speedClampMaxDay": 3.0,
    "speedRatioDay": 1.0
}
```

**Make zombies vanilla strength at all times:**
```json
"zombieBehavior": {
    "healthRatioDay": 1.0,
    "strengthRatioDay": 1.0,
    "visionRatioDay": 1.0
}
```

**More wild dogs and horses:**
```json
"animals": {
    "wildDogs":   { "nominal": 12, "min": 3, "max": 10 },
    "wildHorses": { "nominal": 15, "min": 5, "max": 8 }
}
```

**More saddles and bridles (easier to find horses):**
```json
"horseGear": {
    "saddle": { "nominal": 10, "min": 5 },
    "bridle": { "nominal": 10, "min": 5 }
}
```

**Remove all planes:**
```json
"planes": {
    "dc3":        { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "stuntplane": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "catalina":   { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermoth":  { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermothMk2": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermothMk3": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "spitfire":   { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "cessna":     { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 }
}
```

**More EXP boosters on the map:**
```json
"zenSkills": {
    "expBoostInjector": { "nominal": 20, "min": 10 }
}
```

### Passwords

The default password is `mintmorrogh`. Change it in `server_settings.json` under the `server` section, then run `apply_settings.bat`.

### MWGSM Roaming Trader

A military helicopter trader lands near players every 60 minutes and stays for 30 minutes. The trader sells weapons, ammunition, medical supplies, and attachments for **Roubles** (found as loot around the map). Players are notified with coordinates when the trader arrives and warned 5 minutes before departure.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Spawn interval | Every 60 minutes |
| Duration | 30 minutes |
| Currency | Roubles |
| Stock | 150 items (weapons, ammo, medical, attachments) |
| Guaranteed stock | FAL, AKM, M4A1 |
| Spawn distance | 500-2000m from players |

Config at `config/MWGSM_RoamingTrader/MWGSM_RoamingTraderConfig.json`.

### Care Packages

Randomized supply drops land across the map every 60 minutes. Players are notified in-game with the drop location and distance. Packages are **locked** on drop — press F to open.

| Package Type | Container | Loot |
|---|---|---|
| Military | Typhon camo | 1-3 guns (FAL, AKM, SVD, M4, Mosin, SKS, VSS, Scout) + ammo, mags, optics, NVGs |
| Medical | Red | 8-15 medical items — bandages, morphine, antibiotics, iodine, saline, blood bags |
| Survival | Green | 10-18 food/drink items — canned food, sodas, water, rice + hunting knife or shotgun |
| Tools & Building | Black | 8-14 items — nails, pliers, hacksaw, rope, duct tape, code lock, planks + axes |

17 drop locations spread across Chernarus. 6 zombies guard each drop. Edit loot, locations, and timing in `config/CarePackagesV2/config.json`.

### Nemsis Craftingpack

Adds 500+ craftable items and 700+ recipes. Crafting is vanilla-style — no workbenches needed. Players discover recipes by finding **recipe sketches** in the world, which can be collected in a notebook.

Crafting categories: bushcrafting, makeshift weapons, ammo crafting, armor, improvised NBC gear, vehicles, raiding tools, signs, writing, repairing, and more.

Item spawns are configured in `custom/types_nemsis.xml`.

> **Note:** The Airbrushing addon (`nm_Crafting_Part_Airbrushing.pbo`) was removed from `@NemsisCraftingpack/addons/` because it references classes from a newer version of Mass's Many Item Overhaul than this server uses. This only removes item painting/recoloring — all 700+ crafting recipes still work.

### LMs Planes

Flyable planes spawn across the map at industrial areas and farms (removed town/village spawns to avoid clipping into buildings). Find spare wheels at industrial locations to repair them.

| Plane | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DC-3 | 1 | Large transport plane |
| Stuntplane | 1 | Aerobatic biplane |
| Catalina | 1 | Amphibious seaplane — lands on water |
| Tigermoth | 1 | Classic biplane |
| Tigermoth MK2 | 1 | Variant |
| Tigermoth MK3 | 1 | Variant |
| Spitfire | 1 | WWII fighter |
| Cessna 180 | 1 | Utility plane |
| **Total** | **8** | 1 of each type for 2 players |

Plane spawns are configured in `custom/types_lmplanes.xml`.

### 4KBOSSKVehicles

### CookZ

Adds 30+ craftable food recipes — dishes, soups, sausages, marmalades, and cheese. All items are **crafted only** (nothing spawns in the world). Recipes use vanilla DayZ ingredients and cooking tools.

CookZ Realistic Packaging replaces the default food textures with realistic-looking packaging. It's a visual-only addon — no gameplay changes.

CookZ config auto-generates in `config/CookZ/` on first server start. Item definitions are in `custom/types_cookz.xml`.

### DayZ-Dog — Companion Dogs

17 breeds of tameable wild dogs roam Chernarus. Tame them by feeding raw meat or bones, then command them to follow, stay, or attack. Once tamed, dogs can be equipped with collars, K9 vests, and even gas masks.

Build a dog house from kits found at farms and villages to give your companion a home. Dog houses persist through restarts.

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Collars (7 colours) | 3 each (min 1) | Towns, Villages |
| K9 Vests (6 types) | 3 each (min 1) | Police stations |
| Gas Mask | 3 (min 1) | Military (Tier 3-4) |
| Dog House Kit (small) | 3 (min 1) | Villages, Towns, Farms |
| Dog House Kit (large) | 3 (min 1) | Villages, Towns, Farms |

Dog accessories are configured in `custom/types_dayzdog.xml`. The mod generates a server config at `config/Dayz-Dog/` on first start where you can adjust dog health and behaviour.

### DayZ Horse — Rideable Horses

5 horse colours (Brown, White, Gray, Dark Gray, Palomino) spawn in herds across Chernarus fields and farms. Approach a horse with a bridle to tame it, then equip a saddle to ride. Horses can walk, trot, gallop, jump fences, and swim.

Attach saddlebags for mobile storage. Build a stable from kits found at farms to shelter your horse between sessions.

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Saddle | 5 (min 3) | Farms, Villages |
| Bridle | 5 (min 3) | Farms, Villages |
| Horse Bags (saddlebags) | 4 (min 2) | Farms, Villages |
| Stable Kit | 3 (min 1) | Farms, Villages |

Horse tack is configured in `custom/types_dayzhorse.xml`. Requires the **Survivor Animations** mod as a dependency (included and loaded automatically).

### PvZmoD — Customisable Zombies

Fully configurable zombie behaviour system with independent day and night settings. **Daytime is forgiving** — fewer zombies that are slow, easier to kill, and have poor eyesight, letting players explore and loot in relative safety. **Nighttime is dangerous** — 33% more zombies with full vanilla vision, full strength, and rare sprinters, making darkness a real threat.

| Setting | Day | Night | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spawn count | ~85% culled (~15% survive) | +33% more than baseline | Custom server mod thins the herd by day |
| Speed | Walk/jog only | Walk/jog + rare sprinters | Day capped at run (2.5), night allows sprint (3.0) |
| Speed ratio | 0.75x | 0.95x | Further scales down — most zombies walk by day |
| Health | 0.7x (30% easier kills) | 1.0x (vanilla) | Daytime zombies go down fast |
| Damage | 0.5x (half vanilla) | 0.5x (half vanilla) | Gear lasts much longer from zombie fights |
| Vision | 0.65x (35% shorter) | 1.0x (vanilla) | Easier sneaking during day, full sight at night |
| Size | Normal (disabled) | Normal (disabled) | No random size scaling — all zombies player-sized |

All zombie settings are configurable in `server_settings.json` under `zombieBehavior` and applied automatically by the settings patcher. Changes can also be applied in-game without a restart by pressing **Numpad 4**.

Config files are auto-generated at `config/PvZmoD_CustomisableZombies_Profile/` on first server start.

#### Zombie Health Rebalance

The toughest common zombies (police, military, soldiers) have been rebalanced so they're still noticeably tougher than civilians but not tedious melee sponges. Boss types and walkers are unchanged.

| Zombie | Old HP | New HP | Day knife hits (0.7x) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Civilians / NBC Yellow / Paramedics | 33-100 | No change | 2-6 |
| Gamedev (Dean Hall) | 150 | 120 | 5-6 |
| NBC Grey, Police | 200 | 140 | 6-7 |
| Spec Force, Negan, Soldiers | 250 | 160 | 7-8 |
| Heavy Soldiers, Officer Convoy | 300 | 180 | 8-9 |
| Boss types (Santa, Priest, etc.) | 400-1000 | No change | By design |

### Zombie Kill Drops

Built into the `@DayZombieManager` server mod. Zombies have a chance to drop loot when killed, with different loot tables based on zombie type:

| Zombie Type | Drop Chance | Loot |
|---|---|---|
| Civilian (default) | 25% | Food (apple, pear, plum, canned food), bandages, batteries, matches |
| Military (soldiers) | 30% | Ammo boxes (5.56, 7.62, 9mm, 5.45), AK magazines, compass |
| Police | 30% | Pistol ammo (9mm, .45), pistol magazines, handcuffs, flashlight |
| Medical (doctor/nurse/paramedic) | 35% | Bandages, morphine, antibiotics, saline, vitamins, disinfectant |

Loot spawns on the ground at the zombie's death location. Source code in `mod_src/DayZombieManager/`.

### Campfire Health Regen

Custom server-side mod (`@CampfireRegen`). Players within 5 metres of a burning fire slowly regenerate health and blood:

- **+2 Health** per 10 seconds (max 100)
- **+5 Blood** per 10 seconds (max 5000)

Sitting by a campfire for 5 minutes heals ~60 health and ~150 blood. Not a replacement for medical items, but a quality-of-life reward for the campfire moment.

Source code in `mod_src/CampfireRegen/`.

### Sleep Till Morning

When **all players** on the server lie down to sleep at night, time fast-forwards to dawn. No more waiting around during nighttime. Uses the vanilla "Lie Down" emote — no fatigue system required.

### DayZ Expansion — GPS Minimap

Adds a GPS minimap to the HUD showing your position and surroundings. Requires three dependency mods that also add expanded items, UI enhancements, and framework utilities.

| Mod | Role |
|---|---|
| DayZ-Expansion-Core | Core framework (load first) |
| Dabs Framework | Script/GUI support library |
| DayZ-Expansion | Main content — items, UI, world enhancements |
| DayZ-Expansion-Navigation | Navigation scripts required by GPS overlay |
| Expansion Minimap Override | GPS minimap overlay (load last) |

Load order matters — Core and Dabs must load before Expansion, Navigation must load after Expansion, and the Minimap Override must load last. This is already configured in `start.bat`.

## Launching the Server

1. Double-click `apply_settings.bat` (if you changed any settings)
2. Double-click `start.bat`
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the server to load
4. **Do not press any keys** in the command prompt — any keypress kills the server
5. The server auto-restarts every 4 hours

## Connecting

- **LAN:** DayZ > Servers > LAN tab
- **Direct Connect:** `<server IP>:2302`
- **Password:** Whatever you set in `server_settings.json` (default: `mintmorrogh`)

## Wiping the Server

To start fresh, delete everything inside:
```
mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/storage_1/
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Server crashes on launch:** Check the latest `.RPT` log in the `config/` folder. Usually a mod incompatibility — remove mods from the `-mod=` line in `start.bat` one at a time to isolate.
- **Can't connect:** Make sure your client has the exact same mods enabled. Mod mismatch = connection refused.
- **No loot spawning:** Usually an XML syntax error. Validate your XML files at [codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator](https://codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator).
- **Zombies not spawning:** Same as above — check `events.xml` for syntax errors.
- **Settings not applying:** Make sure you ran `apply_settings.bat` after editing `server_settings.json`, then restarted the server.
- **Dogs/horses not spawning:** Make sure both `dog_territories.xml` and `wild_horse_territories.xml` exist in the `env/` folder, and that `cfgenvironment.xml` references them. Check the events in `db/events.xml` for `AnimalWildDog` and `AnimalWildHorse` entries.
- **Dog health too low:** After first server start, check `config/Dayz-Dog/` for a generated config file where you can increase dog health values.
