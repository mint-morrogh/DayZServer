# BAE-Z — DayZ Private Server

What started as a small DayZ server so I could play co-op with my wife quickly got out of hand. One mod turned into thirty-five, one custom script turned into eight, and before I knew it we had a fully centralized, heavily customized PVE survival experience with companion dogs, rideable horses, flyable planes, roaming traders, and way too many crafting recipes. This is the result — a fleshed-out, relaxed, and genuinely fun co-op DayZ server built from the ground up for 2-player LAN play on Chernarus.

Everything is preconfigured. Clone the repo, subscribe to the Workshop mods, install git so the server will auto update on launch, and play.

### Features

**Companions & Animals**
- **Companion dogs** — 35 breeds of tameable dogs roaming the map in wild packs, equip collars/K9 vests/gas masks, build dog houses, command follow/stay/attack
- **Rideable horses** — 5 horse colours in wild herds, saddles, bridles, saddlebags, buildable stables, walk/trot/gallop/jump/swim
- **Tougher companions** — dogs have doubled HP (1600) and doubled bite damage
- **Companion health regen** — dogs and horses passively regenerate 5% max health every 30 seconds (~10 min from near-death to full)
- **Rebalanced wildlife** — deer, roe deer, cows, goats, pigs, sheep, wild boar, wolves, bears, foxes, hares, and hens all tuned for a populated but performant world

**Vehicles & Transport**
- **38+ driveable vehicles** — 20 custom models (muscle cars, trucks, SUVs, sports cars, monster truck, motorhome) at curated map positions plus ~18 vanilla vehicles — some spawn road-ready, others may require you to find or trade for parts
- **Flyable planes** — DC-3, Spitfire, Cessna 180, Catalina seaplane, Tigermoth, Stuntplane (8 planes, 1 of each type)
- **Unbreakable vehicles** — global health and all individual parts (hood, doors, bumpers, wheels, engine) auto-repair every 60 seconds — ruined parts still need replacing, but damaged parts heal themselves
- **Road-ready vehicles** — vanilla vehicles spawn with 95% wheel chance, 85% battery/radiator/sparkplug chance (up from 60-80%)
- **More gasoline** — 75 gas canisters on map (up from 50), spawn 40-80% full

**Combat & Zombies**
- **Day/night zombie system** — ~65% of zombies culled during daytime (6am-8pm), full spawns at night with rare sprinters
- **Half-damage zombies** — zombie strength set to 0.5x vanilla day and night, gear lasts much longer
- **Rebalanced zombie health** — bullet-sponge zombie types (police, military, soldiers) nerfed to reasonable HP so fights are challenging but not tedious
- **Zombie kill drops** — zombies drop loot when killed: food/bandages from civilians, ammo from military/police, medical supplies from doctors

**Crafting, Cooking & Skills**
- **700+ crafting recipes** — weapons, armor, ammo, vehicles, bushcraft, NBC gear, and more via Nemsis Craftingpack
- **Advanced cooking** — 30+ recipes you can discover via CookZ
- **Skill tree** — earn XP and unlock perks in survival, crafting, hunting, and gathering
- **Shake fruit trees** — hold action on fruit trees to shake loose 2-4 apples/pears/plums (75% drop chance, 30-min cooldown per tree)

**Economy & Trading**
- **NPC traders** — buy and sell items at safe zones using Roubles
- **Roaming military trader** — a helicopter trader lands every 60 minutes near players, stays 30 minutes, trades weapons/ammo/medical/attachments for Roubles (all denominations accepted)
- **Treasure hunting** — find photos, travel to the location, dig up randomized loot stashes
- **Care package supply drops** — military, medical, survival, and building supplies parachute in every 60 minutes, heavily guarded by 12 zombies
- **Stackable items** — roubles, nails, rags, bandages, stones, bones, bark, hooks, worms, and repair kits stack up to 999

**Quality of Life**
- **GPS minimap** — on-screen minimap in top-right corner with player arrow, no GPS item required (toggle with N key)
- **HUD clock** — in-game world time displayed in the top-right corner
- **Percentage HUD** — health, blood, hunger, thirst, and stamina shown as percentages
- **Party system** — create a group with your co-op partner to see each other on the map
- **Sit to rest** — all sit emotes (cross-legged, straight, and SurvivorAnims SitNew) freeze hunger and thirst drain while seated
- **Campfire health regen** — players near a lit fire slowly regenerate health (+2) and blood (+5) every 10 seconds
- **Sleep till morning** — if all players lie down to sleep at night, time skips to dawn
- **Unlimited stamina** — no stamina drain while sprinting
- **Durable gear** — all items self-repair to full health every 2 minutes; tools, weapons, and cooking gear stay pristine
- **63 modded backpacks** — 13 backpack models in multiple camo/colour variants across the map

**World & Loot**
- **Generous loot** — doubled canned food/drinks, 1.5x snacks and candy, tripled cooking pots, enabled crab cans
- **Boosted foraging** — doubled mushroom spawns under trees, boosted fruit drops from apple/pear/plum trees
- **Pristine loot** — items spawn Pristine to Worn only (no more Damaged/Badly Damaged spawns)
- **45-day item persistence** — dropped items last 45 real days on the ground, survive server restarts
- **Indestructible bases** — base structures and storage containers cannot be damaged
- **Fewer contaminated zones** — dynamic NBC zones reduced to 1 (down from 2-4)
- **Reduced shoe damage** — crawler zombie boot damage reduced from 5.0 to 1.0

**Server & Configuration**
- **35 Workshop mods + 5 custom server-side mods + 3 custom client mods** — all preconfigured and ready to go
- **One-file configuration** — all server settings in `server_settings.json`, applied with a single click
- **Auto-restart** — server automatically restarts every 12 hours
- **Full persistence** — bases, vehicles, and inventory survive restarts
- **Auto-update** — `launch_dayz.bat` pulls latest changes, syncs mods, and launches in one click

## Quick Start

### From-Scratch Install (Host — runs the server)

If you're starting from nothing, here's every step:

**1. Install Steam, DayZ, and DayZ Server**

- Install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) if you don't have it
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you don't have it
- Buy and install [DayZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/DayZ/) (the game)
- Install [DayZ Server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223350/DayZ_Server/) (free — Steam Library > dropdown "Games" → "Tools" → search "DayZ Server")

Default install locations:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ\          ← the game
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer\    ← the server
```
These two folders must be siblings under `steamapps\common\` — the launch scripts expect this layout.

**2. Subscribe to all Workshop mods**

Open each link in the [Mods](#mods) section below and click **Subscribe** in the Steam Workshop. There are 33 mods — all must be subscribed.

**3. Launch DayZ once**

Open DayZ from Steam at least once so it finishes downloading all subscribed mod files. You can close it after reaching the main menu.

**4. Clone this repo into the DayZ Server folder**

```bash
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common"
git clone https://github.com/mint-morrogh/BAE-Z-Server.git DayZServer
```
If the folder already exists from installing DayZ Server, clone into a temp folder and copy the files over, or delete the folder first and clone fresh.

**5. Start the server**

```
Double-click: apply_settings.bat     ← applies settings (first time, or after changes)
Double-click: start_server.bat       ← starts the server (wait 1-2 min to load)
```

**6. Launch DayZ and connect**

```
Double-click: launch_dayz.bat
```
This script automatically:
- Pulls the latest config changes from GitHub (`git pull`)
- Installs/updates all 31 Workshop mods into the server directory (copies addons + bikeys)
- Syncs custom client mods to your DayZ game folder
- Launches DayZ with the correct mod list

Connect via DayZ > Servers > LAN, or Direct Connect to `127.0.0.1:2302`.

---

### From-Scratch Install (Player — joining someone else's server)

**1. Install Steam, DayZ, and DayZ Server**

- Install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) if you don't have it
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you don't have it
- Buy and install [DayZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/DayZ/)
- Install [DayZ Server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223350/DayZ_Server/) (free — needed so the launch script has a place to install mods)

**2. Subscribe to all Workshop mods**

Open each link in the [Mods](#mods) section and click **Subscribe**. There are 31 mods.

**3. Launch DayZ once**

Open DayZ from Steam once so it downloads all mod files. Close after reaching the main menu.

**4. Clone this repo into the DayZ Server folder**

```bash
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common"
git clone https://github.com/mint-morrogh/BAE-Z-Server.git DayZServer
```

**5. Launch and connect**

```
Double-click: launch_dayz.bat
```
That's it. The script handles everything else — installs Workshop mods, syncs custom mods, and launches DayZ. Connect to `<host's IP>:2302`. Password: `mintmorrogh` (or whatever the host set).

---

### Staying Up to Date

You don't need to do anything special. Every time you double-click `launch_dayz.bat`, it automatically:
1. Pulls the latest config/balance changes from GitHub
2. Updates any Workshop mods that Steam has refreshed
3. Syncs custom client mods

If the host pushes changes (new settings, balance tweaks, new mods), players get them automatically on next launch.

You can also run `install_mods.bat` standalone if you just want to install/update Workshop mods without launching the game.

## Settings Patcher

Instead of manually editing multiple config files scattered across the server, **all important settings live in one file**: `server_settings.json`.

### How to use

1. Open `server_settings.json` in any text editor
2. Change whatever you want
3. Double-click `apply_settings.bat`
4. Restart your server

That's it. The patcher reads your settings and writes them to the correct config files automatically.

### What you can configure

| Section | What it controls | Config file it patches |
|---|---|---|
| `server` | Name, password, admin password, max players | `serverDZ.cfg` |
| `time` | Day/night speed, start time, persistence | `serverDZ.cfg` |
| `network` | Voice chat, 3rd person, crosshair | `serverDZ.cfg` |
| `gameplay` | Stamina, base damage, map features, base building rules | `cfggameplay.json` |
| `zombies` | Spawn rates per category (city, coastal, military, wilderness, etc.) | `db/events.xml` |
| `zombieBehavior` | Zombie speed, health, damage, and vision — separate day/night values | PvZmoD config XMLs |
| `animals` | Wild dog and horse herd spawn counts | `db/events.xml` |
| `horseGear` | Saddle, bridle, saddlebag, and stable kit spawn rates | `custom/types_dayzhorse.xml` |
| `dogGear` | Collar, vest, gas mask, and dog house kit spawn rates | `custom/types_dayzdog.xml` |
| `planes` | Per-model plane spawn counts (DC-3, Spitfire, Cessna, etc.) | `custom/types_lmplanes.xml` |
| `lootEconomy` | Global zombie/animal caps, loot damage, food decay, respawn timers | `db/globals.xml` |
| `zenSkills` | Skill book and EXP booster spawn rates | `custom/types_zenskills.xml` |

### Example: Common tweaks

**Change your password:**
```json
"server": {
    "password": "mynewpassword",
    "adminPassword": "myadminpass"
}
```

**Make nights shorter (or remove them):**
```json
"time": {
    "acceleration": 6,
    "nightAcceleration": 12
}
```
Higher `nightAcceleration` = shorter nights. Set `acceleration` to 1 for real-time.

**Disable all zombies in the wilderness:**
```json
"zombies": {
    "wilderness": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0, "max": 0 }
}
```

**Double zombies at military bases:**
```json
"zombies": {
    "military":     { "nominal": 100, "min": 50, "max": 500 },
    "militaryHard": { "nominal": 100, "min": 50, "max": 500 }
}
```

**Show your position on the map (easier navigation):**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "showPlayerOnMap": true,
    "mapWithoutItem": true
}
```

**Relaxed base building (place anywhere):**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "relaxedBaseBuilding": true
}
```

**More stamina, less punishing weight:**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "staminaMax": 200.0,
    "staminaWeightThreshold": 12000.0,
    "sprintStaminaModifier": 0.5
}
```

**Make zombies sprint during the day too:**
```json
"zombieBehavior": {
    "speedClampMaxDay": 3.0,
    "speedRatioDay": 1.0
}
```

**Make zombies vanilla strength at all times:**
```json
"zombieBehavior": {
    "healthRatioDay": 1.0,
    "strengthRatioDay": 1.0,
    "visionRatioDay": 1.0
}
```

**More wild dogs and horses:**
```json
"animals": {
    "wildDogs":   { "nominal": 12, "min": 3, "max": 10 },
    "wildHorses": { "nominal": 15, "min": 5, "max": 8 }
}
```

**More saddles and bridles (easier to find horses):**
```json
"horseGear": {
    "saddle": { "nominal": 10, "min": 5 },
    "bridle": { "nominal": 10, "min": 5 }
}
```

**Remove all planes:**
```json
"planes": {
    "dc3":        { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "stuntplane": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "catalina":   { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermoth":  { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermothMk2": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermothMk3": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "spitfire":   { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "cessna":     { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 }
}
```

**More EXP boosters on the map:**
```json
"zenSkills": {
    "expBoostInjector": { "nominal": 20, "min": 10 }
}
```

### Passwords

The default password is `mintmorrogh`. Change it in `server_settings.json` under the `server` section, then run `apply_settings.bat`.

To use admin commands in-game, open chat and type `#login <your admin password>`.

Backpack spawns are configured in `custom/types_gelyabackpacks.xml`.

### Zenarchist's Skills — Loot Spawns

Skill-related items spawn across the map (configurable in `server_settings.json` under `zenSkills`):

| Item | Default Spawns | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| EXP Boost Injector | 10 (min 5) | Medical, Military, Police, Towns |
| Perk Reset Injector | 4 (min 2) | Medical, Military |
| Survival Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Crafting Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Hunting Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Gathering Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |

Items respawn automatically when the count drops below the minimum.

## Dynamic Events

### Static Events (events.xml)

| Event | Vanilla | This Server | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Helicopter crashes | 3 | 5 (min 1) | More crash sites with military loot |
| Military convoys | 5 | 8 (min 2) | More ambushed convoys on roads |
| Contaminated zones | 2-4 | 1 (min 1) | Reduced dynamic NBC zones |

### MWGSM Roaming Trader

A military helicopter trader lands near players every 60 minutes and stays for 30 minutes. The trader sells weapons, ammunition, medical supplies, and attachments for **Roubles** (found as loot around the map). Players are notified with coordinates when the trader arrives and warned 5 minutes before departure.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Spawn interval | Every 60 minutes |
| Duration | 30 minutes |
| Currency | Roubles |
| Stock | 150 items (weapons, ammo, medical, attachments) |
| Guaranteed stock | FAL, AKM, M4A1 |
| Spawn distance | 500-2000m from players |

Config at `config/MWGSM_RoamingTrader/MWGSM_RoamingTraderConfig.json`.

### Care Packages

Randomized supply drops land across the map every 60 minutes. Players are notified in-game with the drop location and distance. Packages are **locked** on drop — press F to open.

| Package Type | Container | Loot |
|---|---|---|
| Military | Typhon camo | 1-3 guns (FAL, AKM, SVD, M4, Mosin, SKS, VSS, Scout) + ammo, mags, optics, NVGs |
| Medical | Red | 8-15 medical items — bandages, morphine, antibiotics, iodine, saline, blood bags |
| Survival | Green | 10-18 food/drink items — canned food, sodas, water, rice + hunting knife or shotgun |
| Tools & Building | Black | 8-14 items — nails, pliers, hacksaw, rope, duct tape, code lock, planks + axes |

17 drop locations spread across Chernarus. 12 zombies guard each drop. Edit loot, locations, and timing in `config/CarePackagesV2/config.json`.

### Nemsis Craftingpack

Adds 500+ craftable items and 700+ recipes. Crafting is vanilla-style — no workbenches needed. Players discover recipes by finding **recipe sketches** in the world, which can be collected in a notebook.

Crafting categories: bushcrafting, makeshift weapons, ammo crafting, armor, improvised NBC gear, vehicles, raiding tools, signs, writing, repairing, and more.

Item spawns are configured in `custom/types_nemsis.xml`.

> **Note:** The Airbrushing addon (`nm_Crafting_Part_Airbrushing.pbo`) was removed from `@NemsisCraftingpack/addons/` because it references classes from a newer version of Mass's Many Item Overhaul than this server uses. This only removes item painting/recoloring — all 700+ crafting recipes still work.

### LMs Planes

Flyable planes spawn across the map at industrial areas and farms (removed town/village spawns to avoid clipping into buildings). Find spare wheels at industrial locations to repair them.

| Plane | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DC-3 | 1 | Large transport plane |
| Stuntplane | 1 | Aerobatic biplane |
| Catalina | 1 | Amphibious seaplane — lands on water |
| Tigermoth | 1 | Classic biplane |
| Tigermoth MK2 | 1 | Variant |
| Tigermoth MK3 | 1 | Variant |
| Spitfire | 1 | WWII fighter |
| Cessna 180 | 1 | Utility plane |
| **Total** | **8** | 1 of each type for 2 players |

Plane spawns are configured in `custom/types_lmplanes.xml`.

### 4KBOSSKVehicles

20 driveable vehicles spawn across the map — 1 of each model, spread across towns, farms, industrial areas, and military bases:

| Vehicle | Count | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Honda Civic | 1 | Town, Village |
| Ford Bronco | 1 | Farm, Village |
| Toyota 4Runner | 1 | Farm, Village |
| Dodge Ram 3500 | 1 | Farm, Industrial |
| Chevy Tahoe | 1 | Town, Farm |
| MotorHome | 1 | Town, Farm |
| Chevrolet Napalm Nova | 1 | Town, Farm |
| Audi RS6 ABT | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| BMW M3 | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Dodge Challenger SRT | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Dodge Charger Hellcat | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Nissan Skyline | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Jeep Gladiator F9 | 1 | Farm, Industrial |
| Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Dodge Ram (camo) | 1 | Farm, Military |
| Porsche 911 RWB | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Toyota Supra MK IV | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Nissan GTR Nismo | 1 | Town, Industrial |
| Ford Raptor Monster Truck | 1 | Farm, Industrial |
| Kamaz Typhoon K | 1 | Military |

Vehicle spawns are configured in `custom/types_4kbossk.xml`. The mod includes 163 color variants — change colors by swapping class names in the types file.

### CookZ

Adds 30+ craftable food recipes — dishes, soups, sausages, marmalades, and cheese. All items are **crafted only** (nothing spawns in the world). Recipes use vanilla DayZ ingredients and cooking tools.

CookZ Realistic Packaging replaces the default food textures with realistic-looking packaging. It's a visual-only addon — no gameplay changes.

CookZ config auto-generates in `config/CookZ/` on first server start. Item definitions are in `custom/types_cookz.xml`.

### DayZ-Dog — Companion Dogs

35 breeds of tameable wild dogs roam Chernarus — one of every breed is always on the map. Tame them by feeding raw meat or bones, then command them to follow, stay, or attack. Once tamed, dogs can be equipped with collars, K9 vests, and even gas masks.

Build a dog house from kits found at farms and villages to give your companion a home. Dog houses persist through restarts.

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Wild dogs | 8 herds (min 3) | Across the map in wild packs |
| Collars (7 colours) | 3 each (min 1) | Towns, Villages |
| K9 Vests (6 types) | 3 each (min 1) | Police stations |
| Gas Mask | 3 (min 1) | Military (Tier 3-4) |
| Dog House Kit (small) | 8 (min 4) | Villages, Towns, Farms |
| Dog House Kit (large) | 8 (min 4) | Villages, Towns, Farms |

Dog accessories are configured in `custom/types_dayzdog.xml`. The mod generates a server config at `config/Dayz-Dog/` on first start where you can adjust dog health and behaviour.

### DayZ Horse — Rideable Horses

5 horse colours (Brown, White, Gray, Dark Gray, Palomino) spawn in herds across Chernarus fields and farms. Approach a horse with a bridle to tame it, then equip a saddle to ride. Horses can walk, trot, gallop, jump fences, and swim.

Attach saddlebags for mobile storage. Build a stable from kits found at farms to shelter your horse between sessions.

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Saddle | 15 (min 8) | Farms, Villages |
| Bridle | 15 (min 8) | Farms, Villages |
| Horse Bags (saddlebags) | 10 (min 5) | Farms, Villages |
| Stable Kit | 5 (min 3) | Farms, Villages |

Horse tack is configured in `custom/types_dayzhorse.xml`. Requires the **Survivor Animations** mod as a dependency (included and loaded automatically).

### PvZmoD — Customisable Zombies

Fully configurable zombie behaviour system with independent day and night settings. **Daytime is forgiving** — fewer zombies that are slow, easier to kill, and have poor eyesight, letting players explore and loot in relative safety. **Nighttime is dangerous** — 33% more zombies with full vanilla vision, full strength, and rare sprinters, making darkness a real threat.

| Setting | Day | Night | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spawn count | ~65% culled (~35% survive) | +33% more than baseline | Custom server mod thins the herd by day |
| Speed | Walk/jog only | Walk/jog + rare sprinters | Day capped at run (2.5), night allows sprint (3.0) |
| Speed ratio | 0.75x | 0.95x | Further scales down — most zombies walk by day |
| Health | 0.7x (30% easier kills) | 1.0x (vanilla) | Daytime zombies go down fast |
| Damage | 0.5x (half vanilla) | 0.5x (half vanilla) | Gear lasts much longer from zombie fights |
| Vision | 0.65x (35% shorter) | 1.0x (vanilla) | Easier sneaking during day, full sight at night |
| Size | Normal (disabled) | Normal (disabled) | No random size scaling — all zombies player-sized |

All zombie settings are configurable in `server_settings.json` under `zombieBehavior` and applied automatically by the settings patcher. Changes can also be applied in-game without a restart by pressing **Numpad 4**.

Config files are auto-generated at `config/PvZmoD_CustomisableZombies_Profile/` on first server start.

#### Zombie Health Rebalance

The toughest common zombies (police, military, soldiers) have been rebalanced so they're still noticeably tougher than civilians but not tedious melee sponges. Boss types and walkers are unchanged.

| Zombie | Old HP | New HP | Day knife hits (0.7x) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Civilians / NBC Yellow / Paramedics | 33-100 | No change | 2-6 |
| Gamedev (Dean Hall) | 150 | 120 | 5-6 |
| NBC Grey, Police | 200 | 140 | 6-7 |
| Spec Force, Negan, Soldiers | 250 | 160 | 7-8 |
| Heavy Soldiers, Officer Convoy | 300 | 180 | 8-9 |
| Boss types (Santa, Priest, etc.) | 400-1000 | No change | By design |

### Zombie Kill Drops

Built into the `@DayZombieManager` server mod. Zombies have a chance to drop loot when killed, with different loot tables based on zombie type:

| Zombie Type | Drop Chance | Loot |
|---|---|---|
| Civilian (default) | 25% | Food (apple, pear, plum, canned food), bandages, batteries, matches |
| Military (soldiers) | 30% | Ammo boxes (5.56, 7.62, 9mm, 5.45), AK magazines, compass |
| Police | 30% | Pistol ammo (9mm, .45), pistol magazines, handcuffs, flashlight |
| Medical (doctor/nurse/paramedic) | 35% | Bandages, morphine, antibiotics, saline, vitamins, disinfectant |

Loot spawns on the ground at the zombie's death location. Source code in `mod_src/DayZombieManager/`.

### Campfire Health Regen

Custom server-side mod (`@CampfireRegen`). Players within 5 metres of a burning fire slowly regenerate health and blood:

- **+2 Health** per 10 seconds (max 100)
- **+5 Blood** per 10 seconds (max 5000)

Sitting by a campfire for 5 minutes heals ~60 health and ~150 blood. Not a replacement for medical items, but a quality-of-life reward for the campfire moment.

Source code in `mod_src/CampfireRegen/`.

### SitRest — AFK Hunger/Thirst Freeze

Custom server-side mod (`@SitRest`). Using any sit emote (SitA, SitB, or SurvivorAnims SitNew) freezes hunger (energy) and thirst (water) drain. Eating and drinking while sitting still works — stats increase and freeze at the new level. Standing up resumes normal drain. Other emotes (wave, lie down, dance) drain normally.

Designed for AFK breaks on a co-op LAN server — sit your character down and step away without starving.

Source code in `mod_src/SitRest/`.

### HealthBoost — Vehicle Durability & Companion Regen

Custom server-side mod (`@HealthBoost`). Two features in one mod:

**Vehicles** — global chassis health and all individual damage zones (hood, doors, bumpers, wheels, engine, etc.) are repaired to max health every 60 seconds. Ruined parts (0 HP) are left alone and still need replacing, but anything damaged heals back to pristine. Fluids and gas still need managing.

**Dogs & Horses** — passive health regen of 5% of max health every 30 seconds. Near-death to full health in ~10 minutes. Only affects entities with "Doggo" or "Horse" in their class name — wolves, deer, and other wildlife are unaffected.

Source code in `mod_src/HealthBoost/`.

### DurableGear — Unbreakable Items

Custom server-side mod (`@DurableGear`). Every item on the server self-repairs to full health every 2 minutes. Tools, weapons, cooking pots, frying pans — everything stays pristine indefinitely. Uses a periodic heal approach since the engine's `DecreaseHealth` is proto native and can't be overridden in script.

Source code in `mod_src/DurableGear/`.

### MinimapTweak — Minimap Customization

Custom client+server mod (`@MinimapTweak`). Adjusts the Expansion GPS minimap:

- **Moves minimap to top-right corner** — standard position for most games
- **Hides coordinate/stats overlay** — removes the large numbers from the minimap (still visible on the full map)
- **Fixes player arrow after Tab** — the player position arrow no longer disappears when opening/closing inventory

This mod loads after `@ExpansionMinimap` and requires it as a dependency. Since it's a client+server mod, players must use `launch_dayz.bat` to start DayZ — it syncs custom mods and loads them automatically.

Source code in `mod_src/MinimapTweak/`.

### HUDClock — In-Game Time Display

Custom client+server mod (`@HUDClock`). Displays the current in-game world time as `HH:MM` in the top-right corner of the HUD. When the Expansion minimap is open, the clock shifts below it so they don't overlap. Hides automatically when menus (inventory, pause) are open.

Depends on `@ExpansionMinimap` for minimap-aware positioning. Source code in `mod_src/HUDClock/`.

### StackableItems — Increased Stack Sizes

Custom client+server mod (`@StackableItems`). Increases the stack limit to 999 for commonly hoarded items that vanilla caps at low numbers:

- **Currency:** All Rouble denominations (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100)
- **Crafting:** Nails, paper, rags, netting, bones, bark (oak/birch), small stones
- **Medical:** Bandage dressings
- **Repair:** Sewing kits, leather sewing kits, epoxy putty, sharpening stones
- **Fishing:** Hooks, worms

Source code in `mod_src/StackableItems/`.

### Sleep Till Morning

When **all players** on the server lie down to sleep at night, time fast-forwards to dawn. No more waiting around during nighttime. Uses the vanilla "Lie Down" emote — no fatigue system required.

### DayZ Expansion — GPS Minimap

Adds a GPS minimap to the HUD showing your position and surroundings. Requires three dependency mods that also add expanded items, UI enhancements, and framework utilities.

| Mod | Role |
|---|---|
| DayZ-Expansion-Core | Core framework (load first) |
| Dabs Framework | Script/GUI support library |
| DayZ-Expansion | Main content — items, UI, world enhancements |
| DayZ-Expansion-Navigation | Navigation scripts required by GPS overlay |
| DayZ-Expansion-Book | Virtual book UI framework |
| DayZ-Expansion-Groups | Party system — see group members on the map |
| Expansion Minimap Override | GPS minimap overlay |
| MinimapTweak | Custom — moves to top-right, hides coords, fixes arrow bug |
| HUDClock | Custom — displays in-game time, positions below minimap |

Load order matters — Core and Dabs must load before Expansion, Book and Groups after Navigation, Minimap Override after Groups, then MinimapTweak and HUDClock. This is already configured in `start_server.bat`. Custom mods are loaded automatically by `launch_dayz.bat`.

## Launching the Server

**Host (runs the server):**

1. Double-click `apply_settings.bat` (if you changed any settings)
2. Double-click `start_server.bat`
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the server to load
4. **Do not press any keys** in the command prompt — any keypress kills the server
5. The server auto-restarts every 12 hours

**Players (including the host):**

1. Double-click `launch_dayz.bat` — pulls updates, installs/updates mods, syncs custom mods, launches DayZ
2. Connect via DayZ > Servers > LAN, or Direct Connect to `127.0.0.1:2302`

## Connecting

- **LAN:** DayZ > Servers > LAN tab
- **Direct Connect:** `<server IP>:2302`
- **Password:** Whatever you set in `server_settings.json` (default: `mintmorrogh`)

## Wiping the Server

Stop the server first (files are locked while running), then delete everything inside these folders:

```
mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/storage_0/
mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/storage_1/
config/Dayz-Dog/players/
config/Zenarchist/Skills/PlayerDB/
config/DataCache/cache.ch
config/DataCache/cache_lock
```

**Note:** The top-level `storage_0/` and `storage_1/` directories are NOT used — persistence lives inside the mission folder.

## Troubleshooting

- **Server crashes on launch:** Check the latest `.RPT` log in the `config/` folder. Usually a mod incompatibility — remove mods from the `-mod=` line in `start_server.bat` one at a time to isolate.
- **Can't connect:** Make sure your client has the exact same mods enabled. Mod mismatch = connection refused.
- **No loot spawning:** Usually an XML syntax error. Validate your XML files at [codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator](https://codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator).
- **Zombies not spawning:** Same as above — check `events.xml` for syntax errors.
- **Settings not applying:** Make sure you ran `apply_settings.bat` after editing `server_settings.json`, then restarted the server.
- **Dogs/horses not spawning:** Make sure both `dog_territories.xml` and `wild_horse_territories.xml` exist in the `env/` folder, and that `cfgenvironment.xml` references them. Check the events in `db/events.xml` for `AnimalWildDog` and `AnimalWildHorse` entries.
- **Dog health too low:** After first server start, check `config/Dayz-Dog/` for a generated config file where you can increase dog health values.
