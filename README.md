# DayZ Private Server Setup Guide

A private DayZ co-op server configured for small groups (2-4 players) on Chernarus. Designed for a relaxed survival experience with quality-of-life mods, faster day/night cycles, and customized zombie spawns.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [DayZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/DayZ/) (game)
- [DayZ Server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223350/DayZ_Server/) (free, under Steam Library > Tools)
- All mods listed below subscribed in the Steam Workshop

### Setup

1. Install **DayZ Server** from Steam (Library > Tools)
2. Clone this repo into your DayZ Server directory, or copy the config files over your installation
3. Subscribe to all required mods in the Steam Workshop (see [Mods](#mods))
4. Launch DayZ once so Steam downloads the mod files
5. Copy each mod's Workshop folder into the server directory with the correct `@Name` (see [Mod Installation](#mod-installation))
6. Copy each mod's `.bikey` file from their `keys/` folder into the server's `keys/` folder
7. Set your passwords in `serverDZ.cfg` (see [Passwords](#passwords))
8. Double-click `start.bat` to launch the server
9. Connect via DayZ > Servers > LAN, or Direct Connect to `127.0.0.1:2302`

### Passwords

Edit `serverDZ.cfg` and change these two lines to your own passwords:

```
password = "mintmorrogh";          // Password players enter to join
passwordAdmin = "mintmorrogh";     // Admin password for in-game commands
```

To use admin commands in-game, open chat and type `#login <your admin password>`.

### Zenarchist's Skills — Loot Spawns

Skill-related items spawn across the map via `mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/custom/types_zenskills.xml`:

| Item | Spawns | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| EXP Boost Injector | 10 (min 5) | Medical, Military, Police, Towns |
| Perk Reset Injector | 4 (min 2) | Medical, Military |
| Survival Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Crafting Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Hunting Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Gathering Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |

Items respawn automatically when the count drops below the minimum.

## Launching the Server

1. Double-click `start.bat`
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for the server to load
3. **Do not press any keys** in the command prompt — any keypress kills the server
4. The server auto-restarts every 4 hours

## Connecting

- **LAN:** DayZ > Servers > LAN tab > "Mint Mundane Server"
- **Direct Connect:** `<server IP>:2302`
- **Password:** Whatever you set in `serverDZ.cfg` (default: `mintmorrogh`)

## Wiping the Server

To start fresh, delete everything inside:
```
mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/storage_1/
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Server crashes on launch:** Check the latest `.RPT` log in the `config/` folder. Usually a mod incompatibility — remove mods from the `-mod=` line in `start.bat` one at a time to isolate.
- **Can't connect:** Make sure your client has the exact same mods enabled. Mod mismatch = connection refused.
- **No loot spawning:** Usually an XML syntax error. Validate your XML files at [codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator](https://codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator).
- **Zombies not spawning:** Same as above — check `events.xml` for syntax errors.
