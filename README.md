## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [DayZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/DayZ/) (game)
- [DayZ Server](https://store.steampowered.com/app/223350/DayZ_Server/) (free, under Steam Library > Tools)
- All mods listed below subscribed in the Steam Workshop

### Setup

1. Install **DayZ Server** from Steam (Library > Tools)
2. Clone this repo into your DayZ Server directory, or copy the config files over your installation
3. Subscribe to all required mods in the Steam Workshop (see [Mods](#mods))
4. Launch DayZ once so Steam downloads the mod files
5. Copy each mod's Workshop folder into the server directory with the correct `@Name` (see [Mod Installation](#mod-installation))
6. Copy each mod's `.bikey` file from their `keys/` folder into the server's `keys/` folder
7. Edit `server_settings.json` to customize your server (see [Settings Patcher](#settings-patcher))
8. Double-click `apply_settings.bat` to apply your settings
9. Double-click `start.bat` to launch the server
10. Connect via DayZ > Servers > LAN, or Direct Connect to `127.0.0.1:2302`

## Settings Patcher

Instead of manually editing multiple config files scattered across the server, **all important settings live in one file**: `server_settings.json`.

### How to use

1. Open `server_settings.json` in any text editor
2. Change whatever you want
3. Double-click `apply_settings.bat`
4. Restart your server

That's it. The patcher reads your settings and writes them to the correct config files automatically.

### Example: Common tweaks

**Change your password:**
```json
"server": {
    "password": "mynewpassword",
    "adminPassword": "myadminpass"
}
```

**Make nights shorter (or remove them):**
```json
"time": {
    "acceleration": 6,
    "nightAcceleration": 12
}
```
Higher `nightAcceleration` = shorter nights. Set `acceleration` to 1 for real-time.

**Disable all zombies in the wilderness:**
```json
"zombies": {
    "wilderness": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0, "max": 0 }
}
```

**Double zombies at military bases:**
```json
"zombies": {
    "military":     { "nominal": 100, "min": 50, "max": 500 },
    "militaryHard": { "nominal": 100, "min": 50, "max": 500 }
}
```

**Show your position on the map (easier navigation):**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "showPlayerOnMap": true,
    "mapWithoutItem": true
}
```

**Relaxed base building (place anywhere):**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "relaxedBaseBuilding": true
}
```

**More stamina, less punishing weight:**
```json
"gameplay": {
    "staminaMax": 200.0,
    "staminaWeightThreshold": 12000.0,
    "sprintStaminaModifier": 0.5
}
```

**Make zombies sprint during the day too:**
```json
"zombieBehavior": {
    "speedClampMaxDay": 3.0,
    "speedRatioDay": 1.0
}
```

**Make zombies vanilla strength at all times:**
```json
"zombieBehavior": {
    "healthRatioDay": 1.0,
    "strengthRatioDay": 1.0,
    "visionRatioDay": 1.0
}
```

**More wild dogs and horses:**
```json
"animals": {
    "wildDogs":   { "nominal": 12, "min": 3, "max": 10 },
    "wildHorses": { "nominal": 15, "min": 5, "max": 8 }
}
```

**More saddles and bridles (easier to find horses):**
```json
"horseGear": {
    "saddle": { "nominal": 10, "min": 5 },
    "bridle": { "nominal": 10, "min": 5 }
}
```

**Remove all planes:**
```json
"planes": {
    "dc3":        { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "stuntplane": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "catalina":   { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermoth":  { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermothMk2": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "tigermothMk3": { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "spitfire":   { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 },
    "cessna":     { "nominal": 0, "min": 0 }
}
```

**Disable sleep fatigue entirely:**
```json
"sleep": {
    "globalDrainMultiplier": 0.0
}
```

**More EXP boosters on the map:**
```json
"zenSkills": {
    "expBoostInjector": { "nominal": 20, "min": 10 }
}
```

### Passwords

### Zenarchist's Skills — Loot Spawns

Skill-related items spawn across the map (configurable in `server_settings.json` under `zenSkills`):

| Item | Default Spawns | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| EXP Boost Injector | 10 (min 5) | Medical, Military, Police, Towns |
| Perk Reset Injector | 4 (min 2) | Medical, Military |
| Survival Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Crafting Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Hunting Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |
| Gathering Book | 6 (min 3) | Everywhere |

Items respawn automatically when the count drops below the minimum.

## Dynamic Events

### Static Events (events.xml)

| Event | Vanilla | This Server | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Helicopter crashes | 3 | 5 (min 1) | More crash sites with military loot |
| Military convoys | 5 | 8 (min 2) | More ambushed convoys on roads |
| Contaminated zones | 2-4 | Unchanged | Dynamic NBC zones |

### Care Packages

Randomized supply drops land across the map every 60 minutes. Players are notified in-game with the drop location and distance. Packages are **locked** on drop — press F to open.

| Package Type | Container | Loot |
|---|---|---|
| Military | Typhon camo | 1-3 guns (FAL, AKM, SVD, M4, Mosin, SKS, VSS, Scout) + ammo, mags, optics, NVGs |
| Medical | Red | 8-15 medical items — bandages, morphine, antibiotics, iodine, saline, blood bags |
| Survival | Green | 10-18 food/drink items — canned food, sodas, water, rice + hunting knife or shotgun |
| Tools & Building | Black | 8-14 items — nails, pliers, hacksaw, rope, duct tape, code lock, planks + axes |

17 drop locations spread across Chernarus. 6 zombies guard each drop. Edit loot, locations, and timing in `config/CarePackagesV2/config.json`.

### Nemsis Craftingpack

Adds 500+ craftable items and 700+ recipes. Crafting is vanilla-style — no workbenches needed. Players discover recipes by finding **recipe sketches** in the world, which can be collected in a notebook.

Crafting categories: bushcrafting, makeshift weapons, ammo crafting, armor, improvised NBC gear, vehicles, raiding tools, signs, writing, repairing, and more.

Item spawns are configured in `custom/types_nemsis.xml`.

> **Note:** The Airbrushing addon (`nm_Crafting_Part_Airbrushing.pbo`) was removed from `@NemsisCraftingpack/addons/` because it references classes from a newer version of Mass's Many Item Overhaul than this server uses. This only removes item painting/recoloring — all 700+ crafting recipes still work.

### LMs Planes

Flyable planes spawn across the map at towns, industrial areas, and farms. Find spare wheels at industrial locations to repair them.

| Plane | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DC-3 | 2 | Large transport plane |
| Stuntplane | 2 | Aerobatic biplane |
| Catalina | 2 | Amphibious seaplane — lands on water |
| Tigermoth | 2 | Classic biplane |
| Tigermoth MK2 | 1 | Variant |
| Tigermoth MK3 | 1 | Variant |
| Spitfire | 2 | WWII fighter |
| Cessna 180 | 2 | Utility plane |
| **Total** | **14** | Keep under 15-30 for performance |

Plane spawns are configured in `custom/types_lmplanes.xml`.

### 4KBOSSKVehicles

20 driveable vehicles spawn across the map at towns, farms, industrial areas, and military bases. One of each model in a random color:

| Vehicle | Location |
|---|---|
| Audi RS6 ABT | Town, Industrial |
| BMW M3 | Town, Industrial |
| Chevrolet Napalm Nova | Town, Farm |
| Dodge Challenger SRT | Town, Industrial |
| Dodge Charger Hellcat | Town, Industrial |
| Dodge Ram 3500 | Farm, Industrial |
| Dodge Ram (camo) | Farm, Military |
| Ford Bronco | Farm, Village |
| Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 | Town, Industrial |
| Ford Raptor Monster Truck | Farm, Industrial |
| Honda Civic | Town, Village |
| Jeep Gladiator F9 | Farm, Industrial |
| Kamaz Typhoon K | Military |
| MotorHome | Town, Farm |
| Nissan Skyline | Town, Industrial |
| Nissan GTR Nismo | Town, Industrial |
| Porsche 911 RWB | Town, Industrial |
| Toyota Supra MK IV | Town, Industrial |
| Chevy Tahoe | Town, Farm |
| Toyota 4Runner | Farm, Village |

Vehicle spawns are configured in `custom/types_4kbossk.xml`. The mod includes 163 color variants — change colors by swapping class names in the types file.

### CookZ

Adds 30+ craftable food recipes — dishes, soups, sausages, marmalades, and cheese. All items are **crafted only** (nothing spawns in the world). Recipes use vanilla DayZ ingredients and cooking tools.

CookZ Realistic Packaging replaces the default food textures with realistic-looking packaging. It's a visual-only addon — no gameplay changes.

CookZ config auto-generates in `config/CookZ/` on first server start. Item definitions are in `custom/types_cookz.xml`.

### DayZ-Dog — Companion Dogs

17 breeds of tameable wild dogs roam Chernarus. Tame them by feeding raw meat or bones, then command them to follow, stay, or attack. Once tamed, dogs can be equipped with collars, K9 vests, and even gas masks.

Build a dog house from kits found at farms and villages to give your companion a home. Dog houses persist through restarts.

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Collars (7 colours) | 3 each (min 1) | Towns, Villages |
| K9 Vests (6 types) | 3 each (min 1) | Police stations |
| Gas Mask | 3 (min 1) | Military (Tier 3-4) |
| Dog House Kit (small) | 3 (min 1) | Villages, Towns, Farms |
| Dog House Kit (large) | 3 (min 1) | Villages, Towns, Farms |

Dog accessories are configured in `custom/types_dayzdog.xml`. The mod generates a server config at `config/Dayz-Dog/` on first start where you can adjust dog health and behaviour.

### DayZ Horse — Rideable Horses

5 horse colours (Brown, White, Gray, Dark Gray, Palomino) spawn in herds across Chernarus fields and farms. Approach a horse with a bridle to tame it, then equip a saddle to ride. Horses can walk, trot, gallop, jump fences, and swim.

Attach saddlebags for mobile storage. Build a stable from kits found at farms to shelter your horse between sessions.

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Saddle | 5 (min 3) | Farms, Villages |
| Bridle | 5 (min 3) | Farms, Villages |
| Horse Bags (saddlebags) | 4 (min 2) | Farms, Villages |
| Stable Kit | 3 (min 1) | Farms, Villages |

Horse tack is configured in `custom/types_dayzhorse.xml`. Requires the **Survivor Animations** mod as a dependency (included and loaded automatically).

### PvZmoD — Customisable Zombies

Fully configurable zombie behaviour system with independent day and night settings. **Daytime is forgiving** — zombies are slow walkers, easier to kill, and have poor eyesight, letting players explore and loot in relative safety. **Nighttime is dangerous** — zombies return to full strength with rare sprinters, making darkness a real threat.

| Setting | Day | Night | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speed | Walk/jog only | Walk/jog + rare sprinters | Day capped at run (2.5), night allows sprint (3.0) |
| Speed ratio | 0.75x | 0.95x | Further scales down — most zombies walk by day |
| Health | 0.7x (30% easier kills) | 1.0x (vanilla) | Daytime zombies go down fast |
| Damage | 1.3x (30% harder hits) | 1.0x (vanilla) | Daytime zombies hit harder to compensate |
| Vision | 0.65x (35% shorter) | 0.8x (vanilla night) | Easier sneaking during the day |

All zombie settings are configurable in `server_settings.json` under `zombieBehavior` and applied automatically by the settings patcher. Changes can also be applied in-game without a restart by pressing **Numpad 4**.

Config files are auto-generated at `config/PvZmoD_CustomisableZombies_Profile/` on first server start.

### Zen's Sleeping Mod

Adds a fatigue stat (moon icon) that drains over time. Players must use the **Lie Down** emote to sleep. Ignoring fatigue causes yawning (gives away position), hallucinations, reduced immunity, and eventually random unconsciousness.

Sleep quality depends on conditions — sleeping at night, near fires, inside buildings, or on sleeping bags recovers fatigue faster and can boost immunity and health.

This server uses a relaxed drain rate (`GlobalDrainMultiplier: 0.4`) — you can play for ~12 real hours before critical fatigue. Fresh spawns start fully rested. Edit the config at `config/Zenarchist/ZenSleepConfig.json`.

Custom items that spawn in the world:

| Item | Count | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| Sleeping bags (5 colors) | 10 each (min 8) | Hunting, Military, Town, Village |
| Anesthetic injector | 5 (min 3) | Medical |
| Amphetamine injector | 5 (min 3) | Medical |

### Sleep Till Morning

Works with Zen's Sleeping Mod. When **all players** on the server lie down to sleep at night, time fast-forwards to dawn. No more waiting around during nighttime.

### DayZ Expansion — GPS Minimap

Adds a GPS minimap to the HUD showing your position and surroundings. Requires three dependency mods that also add expanded items, UI enhancements, and framework utilities.

| Mod | Role |
|---|---|
| DayZ-Expansion-Core | Core framework (load first) |
| Dabs Framework | Script/GUI support library |
| DayZ-Expansion | Main content — items, UI, world enhancements |
| DayZ-Expansion-Navigation | Navigation scripts required by GPS overlay |
| Expansion Minimap Override | GPS minimap overlay (load last) |

Load order matters — Core and Dabs must load before Expansion, Navigation must load after Expansion, and the Minimap Override must load last. This is already configured in `start.bat`.

## Launching the Server

1. Double-click `apply_settings.bat` (if you changed any settings)
2. Double-click `start.bat`
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the server to load
4. **Do not press any keys** in the command prompt — any keypress kills the server
5. The server auto-restarts every 4 hours

## Connecting

- **LAN:** DayZ > Servers > LAN tab
- **Direct Connect:** `<server IP>:2302`
- **Password:** Whatever you set in `server_settings.json` (default: `mintmorrogh`)

## Wiping the Server

To start fresh, delete everything inside:
```
mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/storage_1/
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Server crashes on launch:** Check the latest `.RPT` log in the `config/` folder. Usually a mod incompatibility — remove mods from the `-mod=` line in `start.bat` one at a time to isolate.
- **Can't connect:** Make sure your client has the exact same mods enabled. Mod mismatch = connection refused.
- **No loot spawning:** Usually an XML syntax error. Validate your XML files at [codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator](https://codebeautify.org/xmlvalidator).
- **Zombies not spawning:** Same as above — check `events.xml` for syntax errors.
- **Settings not applying:** Make sure you ran `apply_settings.bat` after editing `server_settings.json`, then restarted the server.
- **Adding/removing Zen's Sleep:** Requires a server wipe (`storage_1/`) because the sleep stat is saved to player profiles. Without a wipe, profiles become corrupted.
- **Dogs/horses not spawning:** Make sure both `dog_territories.xml` and `wild_horse_territories.xml` exist in the `env/` folder, and that `cfgenvironment.xml` references them. Check the events in `db/events.xml` for `AnimalWildDog` and `AnimalWildHorse` entries.
- **Dog health too low:** After first server start, check `config/Dayz-Dog/` for a generated config file where you can increase dog health values.
