### DayZ-Dog: IntroSceneCharacter startup crash — PATCHED (needs testing)

**Problem:** DayZ-Dog overrides `IntroSceneCharacter::CharacterLoad` to spawn a dog on the main menu. When `m_CharacterDta` is null during heavy mod loading, `CreateCharacterPerson()` crashes with `Access violation at 0x8`.

**Fix:** Patched PBO reimplements `CharacterLoad` with null guards around `m_CharacterDta` and `m_CharacterObj` instead of calling `super` (which crashes). Source: `mod_src/DayZDogPatch/scripts/4_world/overrides/IntroSceneCharacter.c`.

**Deployment:**
- Built PBO cached at `mod_src/DayZDogPatch/dayz_dog.pbo.patched` (691MB — NOT committed to git, too large)
- `LAUNCH_DAYZ.bat` Fix 6 auto-patches Workshop folder on client launch
- `install_mods.bat` post-install step auto-patches server `@DayZDog/addons/`
- Source script tracked in git at `mod_src/DayZDogPatch/scripts/`

**Status:** Patched PBO is deployed to Workshop and server. Needs testing — start client, verify mannequin + dog appear on main menu without crashing.

**If PBO needs rebuilding** (e.g. DayZ-Dog Workshop update):
1. Extract fresh DayZ-Dog PBO contents to `mod_src/DayZDogPatch/`
2. Replace scripts with our patched version from `mod_src/DayZDogPatch/scripts/`
3. Move `dayz_dog.pbo.patched` OUT of the directory (prevent PBO-inside-PBO)
4. Build: `cd mod_src/DayZDogPatch && pbo -b -H "prefix=Dayz_Dog" -P "**/*" ../../dayz_dog.pbo.patched .`
5. Move `dayz_dog.pbo.patched` back into `mod_src/DayZDogPatch/`

### Vehicles: Random colors + all models for 4KBOSSK spawns
- **Issue:** Currently each of the 20 vehicles spawns as 1 fixed color (e.g. always a Black Audi, always a Blue BMW). Also missing several available models entirely (NissanGTR non-Nismo, NissanGTRCustom, GMC_BOSS, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo IX).
- **Goal:** Still only 1 of each vehicle model on the server, but the color is randomized each spawn. Add the missing models too.
- **How it works:** In `events.xml`, replace each single-color child with ALL color variants for that model, all sharing the same `max=1 min=1`. The CE picks one randomly from the pool per model.
- **Config location:** `mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/db/events.xml` → `Vehicle4KBOSSK` event
- **Also needs:** `cfgspawnabletypes.xml` entries for any new models added, and `types_4kbossk.xml` entries with nominal=0 for new models

#### Current → New child entries per model:
Replace each single child with all color variants. Example for Audi:
```xml
// BEFORE: 1 fixed color
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Black" />

// AFTER: all 9 colors, CE picks 1 randomly
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Black" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_White" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Red" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Blue" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Yellow" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Green" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Pink" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_Teal" />
<child lootmax="0" lootmin="0" max="1" min="1" type="Audi_RS6_ABT_MidNightBlue" />
```
Do the same for all 20+ models.

#### All available color variants by model:
- **Audi_RS6_ABT** (9): Black, White, Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Pink, Teal, MidNightBlue
- **BMW_M3** (7): White, Black, MidNightBlue, Green, Orange, Red, Blue

- **Dodge_ChallengerSRT** (7): Black, Blue, DarkBlue, Green, Orange, Red, White
- **dodgechargerhellcat** (7): black, blue, green, red, pink, lightblue, white
- **DodgeRam_BOSS** (22): Black, Blue, BlueTiger, CamoGreen, ChinaLake, Cyan, DUDB, Green, Mocha, ModernWoodland, Orange, Pink, Red, RedTiger, Rust, Skulls, TopoGraphic, TopoTrip, VectorTrails, White, Woodland_Blue, Woodland_Nightfrost, Woodland_Sand, camogreen
- **Ford_Bronco** (5): Black, Blue, Hunter, Rust, White
- **Ford_Mustang_Shelby_GT500** (8): Black, Blue, DarkBlue, Green, Orange, Pink, Red, White
- **Ford_Raptor_MonsterTruck** (7): Black (base), Baja, Halo, Raptor, Roush, USA, WideOpen
- **Civic** (7): White, Red, Blue, Black, Yellow, Green, RedCustom
- **Jeep_GladiatorF9_BOSS** (25): Black, Brown, Cyan, Green, Orange, Pink, Red, White, DarkRed, camo_abominable, camo_black, camo_blue, camo_blue2, camo_bluetiger, camo_dragonmoss, camo_flecktarn, camo_green, camo_hunter, camo_nightseas, camo_orange, camo_pinkpython, camo_red, camo_redtiger, camo_skulls, camo_topotrip, camo_vanished
- **Kamaz_TyphoonK** (8): Black, CamoGreen, CamoGreen2, CamoGreen3, Green, RedCamo, Rusty, White
- **MotorHome** (4): Apo, GreenCamo, Rust, White
- **Nissan_Skyline** (6): Black, Blue, Orange, Pink, Red, White
- **NissanGTRNismo** (4): Black, DarkPurple, Red, White

- **ToyotaRunner** (14): Black, blue, pink, red, white, yellow, camoblack, camoblue, camogreen, camopink, camopurple, camored, camowhite

#### New models to add (not currently spawning):
- **NissanGTR** (6 colors): Blue, Green, Orange, Pink, Red, White
- **NissanGTRCustom** (4 colors): Black, Blood, LB, Pink
- **GMC_BOSS** (check for colors)
- **Mitsubishi_LancerEvolutionIX_BOSS** (check for colors)
- **DodgeRam_3500** (check for colors — currently spawning Grey but may have more)

#### When implementing:
- Update `nominal` in events.xml to match new total model count (20 + new models)
- Update `max` in events.xml to keep more positions than vehicles for randomness
- Add types.xml entries (nominal=0) for any new models
- Add cfgspawnabletypes.xml entries for any new models (matching wheel types)
- **Requires server restart** (events.xml is loaded at startup)



### ~~Vehicle Damage: Tune SFE No Vehicle Damage speed threshold~~ — DONE
- SFE: No Vehicle Damage installed and working. Minor collisions no longer ruin parts.

### ~~SitRest: "Sit B" (straight) emote not freezing hunger/thirst~~ — FIXED
- SitB confirmed working. SitRest expanded to cover all rest emotes: SitA, SitB, Campfire Sit, Lying Down, SurvivorAnims SitNew.

### ~~Trader: Split Vehicle Parts into multiple tabs~~ — DONE
- Split single 1300-line Vehicle Parts tab into 6 categories: Engine & Fluids, Vanilla Vehicle Parts, Modded Wheels, 4KBOSSK Parts (Audi-Dodge), 4KBOSSK Parts (Ford-Kamaz), 4KBOSSK Parts (Mitsubishi-Toyota).

### Trader: Weapon Trader OOM crash when searching "smoke"
- **Issue:** Game crashes with out of memory error when using the search bar in the Weapon Trader and typing "smoke". Weapon Supplies (236 items) does NOT crash on the same search — only Weapon Trader (172 items).
- **Root cause:** The Trader mod's `SearchForItems()` scans all items in the trader, auto-selects the first match, and calls `updateItemPreview()` which spawns a real 3D entity via `GetGame().CreateObject()`. Searching "smoke" matches 11 items (M18 smoke grenades × 5 colors, RDG2 × 2, Ammo_40mm_Smoke × 4). As the user types each character ("s", "sm", "smo"...), a new search fires and creates a new preview object. Old previews are deferred-deleted, so rapid creation piles up 3D weapon models in memory. Weapon Trader items have larger models than Weapon Supplies ammo/attachments, causing the OOM.
- **All classnames are valid** — every smoke item exists in vanilla types.xml. This is NOT a bad reference, it's a preview memory pileup.
- **Diagnosis:** Check client RPT log (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/DayZ/`) after crash for the last classname passed to `CreateObject()`.
- **Fix options:**
  1. Reduce smoke item count in Grenades category (remove duplicate colors, keep Red/Green/White only)
  2. Split Grenades into sub-categories so fewer items match per search
  3. Move 40mm ammo to Weapon Supplies (keeps them searchable but away from the heavy weapon models)
- **Config:** `config/Trader/TraderConfig.txt` lines 513-531 (Grenades category)

## Pending (no server stop needed)

### Freeze Mods: Lock all mod versions to prevent Workshop updates from breaking the server
- **Goal:** Snapshot all current working mod versions so Steam Workshop updates can't break anything.
- **How it works:**
  1. Create `FREEZE_MODS.bat` that copies ALL Workshop mod folders (`steamapps/workshop/content/221100/<id>/`) to a local `@Frozen/<ModName>/` directory
  2. Update `LAUNCH_DAYZ.bat` to load client mods from `@Frozen/` paths instead of `!Workshop` symlinks
  3. Update `START_SERVER.bat` `-mod=` and `-serverMod=` to also point at `@Frozen/` copies
  4. Stop running `INSTALL_MODS.bat` after freezing (it would overwrite frozen copies with new Workshop versions)
- **To update a specific mod later:** Re-run `INSTALL_MODS.bat` for just that mod, test it, then copy the updated version into `@Frozen/`
- **To update everything:** Re-run `INSTALL_MODS.bat` for all mods, test, then re-run `FREEZE_MODS.bat` to snapshot the new working set
- **Rollback:** Keep a `@Frozen_backup/` copy before updating so you can restore if something breaks
- **Note:** Our custom patches (SurvivorAnims, etc.) must be re-applied after any mod update — `INSTALL_MODS.bat` already handles this
- **When:** After all current fixes are stable and tested

## Completed

### Enable Inventory In Vehicle + Sit Emotes — DONE
- Custom client+server mod (`-mod=`) replaces removed Workshop mod (3594596641).

- Added to `-mod=` in `START_SERVER.bat`, `CUSTOM_MODS` + sync in `LAUNCH_DAYZ.bat`.

### Dogs & Horses not spawning — FIXED
- `AnimalMaxCount` set to 1200 (was 200). Vanilla herds consumed all entity slots. Dogs, horses, wolves, sheep now all spawning. Confirmed in-game Mar 2.

### Roaming Trader: "Nails" currency + missing denominations — FIXED
- Client reads config from `Documents\DayZ\` not server `config/`. Copied config to client profile dir, added ruble denominations, automated sync in `LAUNCH_DAYZ.bat`.

### Trader additions — ALL DONE
- Vehicle wheels: 19 4KBOSSK + 10 LM Planes wheels added to Vehicle Parts
- Building Kits: stable, dog sheds, raft/buggy, vanilla kits added to Misc Trader
- Horse Tack: saddle, bridle, horse bags added to Misc Trader

### Zombie daytime spawn rate increase — DONE
- DayZombieManager `DAY_DESPAWN_CHANCE` reduced from 0.85 to 0.55 (45% survive during day, up from 15%). Compensates for zombies being less tanky after PvZmoD nerf. (0.85→0.65 initial, then 0.65→0.55 bump on Mar 9)

### Vanilla animal nominals reduced — DONE
- Reduced vanilla herd nominals in events.xml to leave more room under AnimalMaxCount=1200 cap. Dog nominal reduced from 35→8 (~100 entities). Vanilla animals rebalanced to lower counts.
